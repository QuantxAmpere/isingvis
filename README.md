# isingvis
Visualization of the Ising Model using gnuplot

## usage
build using `make`

run live visualization using `make live`. this needs gnuplot installed

export the animation to a gif using `make movie`. this needs gnuplot and ffmpeg installed.

export the average magnetization of the system over time to a textfile using `make magnetization`. this currently still requires gnuplot even tho it's not really used *shrug*
